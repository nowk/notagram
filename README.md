> Notion Page to Instagram Process

## TODO

- [ ] Some basic code clean up
- [ ] Flush out error handling
- [ ] Support for scheduling
- [ ] Support for video media types
- [ ] Support for Single image publishing (instagram API is different for single images vs "albums")
- [ ] Some configuration support for completion and error callbacks (eg. On a failed post, it should update the page with the error so it can be fixed and requeued for publish)
- [ ] Docker + systemd startup files
- [ ] Metric information (Some way to support metric info, like post counts, scheduled counts, etc... Some useful metrics, not for analytics specifically)
